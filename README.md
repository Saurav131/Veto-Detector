# Charge changing cross section measurements.
Geant4 simulation of the response of a veto detector with various beam energies for the measurement of 
charge-changing cross-section (CCCS) of 12C on a carbon target


- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Saurav Mittal ,a physics student with an engineering degree.
- ðŸ‘€ I want to work in high energy physics and nuclear physics.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Gravitaional waves project , Nuclear projects or any other project you have in mind.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me Sauravmittal131@gmail.com.
- The CCCS simulation folder have the Geant4 repository.
- The Graphs folder contain code to analyse data using CERN ROOT.
